description: 'The abstract to the original (2008) Bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto: A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.'

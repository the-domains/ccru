description: "Ethereum is a distributed computing system for writing and executing smart contracts. Inspired by Bitcoin, it's currently in development with a planned late 2014 release date. The term \"smart contracts\" was coined around 1993 by computer scientist Nick Szabo to describe computer-readable code that replaces lawyer-readable code to describe agreements and obligations between people."

description: 'The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot - including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics - they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.'
